# DHT11 Interface with Basys Board (Verilog)

This project demonstrates how to interface a **DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor** with a **Basys board** using Verilog. The DHT11 sensor is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor, which communicates using a proprietary one-wire protocol. The Verilog code provided implements the required communication protocol and processes the sensor data to extract temperature and humidity values.

## Project Overview

The DHT11 sensor communicates via a single data pin. The Basys board initiates communication by sending a start signal, after which the DHT11 responds with 40 bits of data (16 bits for humidity, 16 bits for temperature, and 8 bits for a checksum).

This Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) that handles:
1. **Sending a start signal** to the sensor.
2. **Waiting for the sensor’s response**.
3. **Reading and processing the 40-bit data frame**.
4. **Extracting temperature and humidity values**.

### Features
- Interfaces with the DHT11 sensor via a single GPIO pin on the Basys board.
- Receives temperature and humidity data from the DHT11.
- Verifies data using the checksum.
- Outputs the temperature and humidity values as 8-bit integers.

## Requirements

### Hardware:
- **Basys 3 FPGA Board** (or other Xilinx FPGA)
- **DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
- **10kΩ Pull-up Resistor** for the DHT11 data line

### Software:
- **Vivado** or another Xilinx IDE for FPGA programming.
- Basic understanding of Verilog and FPGA design.

## Pin Connections

- **DHT11 Data Pin**: Connect to a suitable GPIO pin on the Basys board (e.g., JB or JC header pins).
- **DHT11 VCC**: Connect to the 3.3V or 5V supply on the Basys board.
- **DHT11 GND**: Connect to the ground pin on the Basys board.
- **Pull-up Resistor**: Connect between the data pin and VCC to ensure the data line remains high when idle.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository** or download the Verilog files.
2. Open the project in **Vivado** or any Xilinx development environment.
3. Assign the **GPIO pin** for the DHT11 data line in the constraints file (`.xdc`).
4. Synthesize, implement, and upload the design to the Basys board.
5. Connect the **DHT11 sensor** to the Basys board as described above.
6. Once the program is running on the FPGA, the **temperature** and **humidity** values will be available on the designated output signals (`temp`, `hum`, `ready`).

## Code Explanation

### FSM (Finite State Machine)
The FSM drives the interaction with the DHT11 sensor. The main states are:
1. **IDLE**: Waiting for a start signal from the user to initiate communication.
2. **SEND_START**: Sends a low signal to the DHT11 for at least 18ms to initiate communication.
3. **WAIT_RESPONSE**: Waits for the sensor to respond with a low signal followed by a high signal.
4. **READ_DATA**: Reads the 40-bit data frame from the sensor, bit by bit.
5. **PROCESS_DATA**: Processes the received data, extracts temperature and humidity values, and verifies the checksum.

### Timing Control
Timing is crucial for reading data from the DHT11 sensor. The FSM uses a counter to manage timing intervals based on the Basys board's clock frequency (usually 100 MHz).

### Outputs
- **`temp [7:0]`**: The 8-bit temperature value (integer part).
- **`hum [7:0]`**: The 8-bit humidity value (integer part).
- **`ready`**: A flag to indicate when valid data is available.

### Verilog Modules
The main module `dht11_interface` handles the sensor communication and data processing.

```verilog
module dht11_interface(
    input wire clk,          // System clock
    inout wire dht_data,     // DHT11 data pin (bidirectional)
    output reg [7:0] temp,   // Temperature data
    output reg [7:0] hum,    // Humidity data
    output reg ready         // Flag to indicate data is ready
);
```

- The **`dht_data`** signal is bidirectional, meaning it is used both to send the start signal and to receive data from the sensor.

## Testing and Debugging

### Simulation:
You can simulate the design using a testbench in Verilog to verify the FSM state transitions and timing accuracy. Ensure that the timing constraints for the start signal and data reading are accurate.

### Debugging:
If the sensor is not providing valid data, check the following:
- Ensure the timing of the start signal is correct (at least 18ms low, followed by a high signal).
- Verify that the sensor is correctly connected, and the pull-up resistor is in place.
- Use a logic analyzer to observe the data pin and check if the sensor is responding.
